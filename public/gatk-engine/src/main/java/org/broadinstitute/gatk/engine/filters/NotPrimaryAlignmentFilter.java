/**
 * Filter out reads that are secondary alignments
 *
 * <p>This filter recognizes the SAM flag that identifies secondary alignments (ie not the best alignment).
 * It is intended to ensure that only reads that are likely to be mapped in the right place, and therefore to be
 * informative, will be used in analysis.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Usage example</h3>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     java -jar GenomeAnalysisTk.jar \
 *         -T ToolName \
 *         -R reference.fasta \
 *         -I input.bam \
 *         -o output.file \
 *         -rf NotPrimaryAlignment
